        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>By accessing the Ministry of Groove (M.O.G.) Grid via the "Google Link," you agree to use this platform for legitimate communication and creative collaboration within the eMalahleni collective.</p>

        <h3>3. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>All brand assets, including the M.O.G. logo and "ORIGIN 54" concepts, remain the property of the Director. User-uploaded "Visual Intel" remains the property of the uploader, but M.O.G. is granted a license to display it within the Grid archive.</p>

        <h3>4. Account Termination</h3>
        <p>The Director reserves the right to revoke access to any operative who violates the sovereignty of the Grid or disrupts the Frequency Comms.</p>
